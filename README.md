# Solar PV Performance Ratio (PR) Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing the Performance Ratio (PR) of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The PR is a key metric indicating the efficiency and health of a solar installation, showing how much energy is actually produced compared to the theoretical maximum, adjusted for system losses.

This project aims to:
* Automate the combination and merging of daily Performance Ratio (PR) and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data from various CSV files.
* Visualize the PR evolution over time, including daily values, moving averages, and comparison against a degradation budget.
* Provide statistical summaries of PR performance across different timeframes.
* Offer insights into system health and potential areas for investigation.
